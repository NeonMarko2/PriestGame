# Priest game: https://youtu.be/humbCIFNSRw?si=443DzxgQp9uEsO9F
Priest game is the current project that Im working on. It involves numerous system like:
- Character controller
- Movement script, used both by the Player characters and Ai
- Multiple characters
- Character Swap
- Shooting for character 1
- Using a ocarina of time like note playing ability on the second character
- A rolling move for both characters where they are invincible to enemy attacks
- State machine designed to be scalable, used by both the Player characters and Ai
- Currently 3 different enemies
- Game manager
- Damage interface for dealing damage to Players and Ai
- Extensive Dialogue system, allows for spawning speech bubbles above "Speakers"
- Custom cutscene system I built to fit the needs of my game
- Custom tools for the cutscene system (called Sequencer) I built to maximize my efficiency using the Cutscene system
- Many camera systems (Battle camera, Camera shake, Camera zoom, Smooth camera tweening from point a to point b)
- Shader for a custom vignette on the screen

And many, many other smaller systems and scripts
